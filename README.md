Simple TikTacToe App where I explore React Native Framework to play around with game settings and such.
Used Redux to store states.

In this game you have 3 modes of TikTacToe:
<ul>
  <li>3x3 Boardgame
  <li>4x4 Boardgame
  <li>5x5 Boardgame
</ul>

The app work but several optimizations on the algorithm and oberal React Native App structure must be urgently revised. 
This was my first React Native App :)
